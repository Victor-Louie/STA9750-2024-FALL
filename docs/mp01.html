<p>The previous code will download, clean, and join the tables. The 2022 Fare Revenue file contains all the data of transit Agency, Urbanized Area Name, Mode of transportation, date, Number of Passengers, metro area, and the miles that vehicles travel while in revenue service. The file will later be joined to the expense file that documents the expenses in 2022.</p>
<p>Using the above data we can create a comprehensive analysis of how much each transit agency earns in fares relative to their expenses. Later into the project, I will be joining the fare revenue data with the expense file, we can directly compare the income generated by different transit modes against the expenses incurred in running these services. This comparison will provide insights into which transit system in the country are more effective to another.</p>

<p>Tidyverse will help the clarity of the data by manipulating and visualizing the data. Using the select() and filter() functions from dplyr package, I am able to make the data set more manageable and focused on relevant data for specific questions to answer. Columns such as State/Parent NYT ID would not be needed and thus, excluded out. Similar to the Fares and Expenses files, a csv.reader is used to scan large files to output. The rename function would change UZA Name to metro_area, thus becoming more coherent. The USAGE table was created By joining the TRIPS table and MILES table and the FINANCIALS table was created by joining the FARES and EXPENSES tables.</p>

<p>The Mode column uses a set of codes that arenâ€™t interpretative. To make the code easy to read, a case_when statement is to transform into something we can make sense of. From the <a href="https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd/national-transit-database-ntd-glossary">NTD website</a>, I was able to find the abbreviations and reverse it.</p>

<p>Similarly to the USAGE MODE Column, to ensure all the data is consistent, it is crucial to do the same in the FINANCALS table.The code filter uses the year() function from lubridate package It then groups the data by <code>NTD ID</code>, Agency, metro_area, Mode.The summarize function calculates the total Unlinked Passenger Trips (UPT) and Vehicle Revenue Miles and sums up the total. After summarizing, ungroup() is called to remove the grouping,making the dataset easier to work with.</p>
